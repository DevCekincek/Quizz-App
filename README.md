Article Quizzer – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-12

1. Data we access
Article Quizzer reads the text content of the web page you have open in your browser when you explicitly use the extension (for example, when you click the extension icon and request a quiz). The extension may send this article text to our backend service in order to generate quiz questions, evaluate your answers, and highlight parts of the article.

2. Data we do not collect
We do not intentionally collect login credentials, payment information, or other sensitive personal data. The extension only processes page text for the purpose of generating quizzes and explanations. We do not use this data for advertising or user profiling.

3. Storage and retention
Quiz data is stored only as needed to provide the quiz experience (for example, temporarily in your browser). We do not permanently store article content or quiz answers on our servers beyond what is technically necessary to generate and return results.

4. Third‑party services
Our backend may use third‑party AI providers to generate quiz questions and explanations. These providers receive only the text necessary to perform that function, and are contractually restricted from using it for unrelated purposes.

5. Contact
If you have any questions about this policy or how your data is handled, contact us at: YOUR_EMAIL_HERE.
